The animal on the cover of Rust Atomics and Locks is a Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi). This species of brown bear is endemic to the Kodiak Archipelago of Alaska. They have been isolated from other bears for roughly 12,000 years.

Kodiak bears are one of the largest bears in the world. A male can stand 10 feet tall on his hind legs and 5 feet tall on all four. Males can weigh up to 1,500 pounds while females are 20% to 30% smaller. They are larger than black bears, showcasing a more prominent shoulder hump, less prominent ears, and longer, straighter claws. While they are a type of brown bear, they cannot be easily identified by the color of their fur, which can range from dark brown to light blonde.

The Kodiak Archipelago hosts a pristine landscape for the bears. Its temperate forests are full of lush greenery that flourishes due to ample amounts of rain. Winters on the archipelago are long and cold, followed by mild summers. The bears take advantage of the climate by optimizing their diet for whatever is in season. During spring and early summer they feed on rapidly growing grasses. Berries are consumed during late summer and early fall. Salmon runs last from May through September, and the bears feast on Pacific salmon that spawn in nearby lakes and streams. They are easily adaptable and can be drawn to improperly stored garbage and food at human campsites and homes.

Kodiak bears were once actively hunted to protect livestock, but hunting is now regulated to keep the population thriving. As a result, Kodiak bears have a conservation status of Least Concern. Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world.
